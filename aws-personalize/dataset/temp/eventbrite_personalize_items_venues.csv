Present Like A Pro is what you'll do after learning how to design and deliver effective presentations. Increasingly, it's not just what you meant to say, but how you say it that makes the difference. Learn how to organize a powerful presentation, use PowerPoint visuals that complement your speech, and present with confidence and impact. In a small group setting, you will apply the principles to your presentation, and then present it to the group, using feedback from the videotape and the group to perfect your style.
This one-day workshop format is very intense. Prior to the program, you submit a needs assessment survey and sample presentation to work on during the workshop. We start by learning presentation fundamentals, which you apply to your presentation. Then, you practice presenting it and use feedback from watching yourself on video, and from the class, so you can develop and deliver powerful presentations. During the following two-weeks; you can tweak your presentation and send it to the coach for more feedback, as well as pose additional questions.
What You Will Learn


Focus the content (i.e., What's the point? Are the key messages clear?)


Organize the presentation to produce easy comprehension.


Use a compelling style (i.e., use ""power"" words and charts)


Transform boring/complex concepts into powerful ""visual metaphors""


Coordinate your speech and the visuals so they complement one another


Develop a clear, properly paced, speaking style that makes you feel comfortable and powerful, and ""speaks"" your audience's language


 
How You Will Benefit


More succinct and focused presentations


PowerPoint presentations that are easy to follow and interesting to watch


More confidence in your public speaking skills


More power and punch in your presentation style - for greater impact!


  Who Should Attend


Senior Executives with sales, marketing, human resources responsibilities; other managers who communicate with staff, investors, board, and vendors.
